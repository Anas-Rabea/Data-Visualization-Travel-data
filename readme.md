## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the
Arrival delay and Airline delay. With figuring out the effects of weather delay for each month, you can see that February
has a little high effect  comapared to January and December months , though they present the winter season.
Peformance of security for each airport is very good for that year,2015.

>For Airsystem delay the Airline of HA has done a great job through the year, followed by Airline of WN.
On other hand , AA airline company has the worst job done for shoten the airline delay 
Ignoring the inevitable reasons of delays such as wether and security ,  we find that HA Airline has really done a great job , followed by Airlines of AS and US consecutively.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on  the efffect of evitable causes od delays like ariline , airsystem , and air craft on arrival delay.
I start by ploting the distribution of arrival delay , followed by the plot relation between airline and arrival delay.

> Then , I plot the mean time delayed caused for each month focusing on Feb , Jan and Dec. Finally , I looked at airline delay and arrival delay for each airline company.
